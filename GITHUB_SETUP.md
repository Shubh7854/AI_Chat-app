## ðŸ”— Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

### 2.1 Copy Repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. Copy the repository URL (it looks like):
```
https://github.com/your-username/ai-chat-app.git
```

### 2.2 Add Remote Origin
In your terminal (make sure you're in the project directory), run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ai-chat-app.git
```

### 2.3 Verify Remote
```bash
git remote -v
```
You should see your repository URL listed.

## ðŸ“¤ Step 3: Push to GitHub

### 3.1 Push to Main Branch
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3.2 Enter Credentials
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Your GitHub personal access token (not your account password)

> **Note**: If you don't have a personal access token, you'll need to create one:
> 1. Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
> 2. Generate new token with "repo" permissions
> 3. Use this token as your password

---

## âœ… Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Go back to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see all your files uploaded
4. Check that the README.md displays properly

---

## ðŸ”„ Step 5: Future Updates

Whenever you make changes to your code:

```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Authentication Failed
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
- Check that your token has the correct permissions

#### 2. Repository Already Exists
- If you accidentally created a repository with a README, you can:
  - Delete the repository and create a new one, OR
  - Pull the existing repository first: `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`

#### 3. Permission Denied
- Check your GitHub username and token
- Make sure you have write access to the repository

#### 4. Large Files
- If you have large files, consider using Git LFS or adding them to .gitignore

2. **Add collaborators** if working with a team
3. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (optional)
4. **Create issues** for future features
5. **Add a license** if needed
